This file, "totalstrokes.txt", contains pairs of unicode values for all 
Chinese characters and their associated stroke count.

This file was originally obtained from Stephen Politzer-Ahles on his
website: www.mypolyuweb.hk/~sjpolit/cgi-bin/strokecounter.pl

The file can be gotten by downloading his file "strokecounter_batchmode.zip"
which comes with this file and some other stuff such as a pearl script
to read the file and some test files. The other files were deleted
as they were not relevant to this project.

Stephen says he initially got this file from Unihan database at
"www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html" however I could not find it when
I myself looked there.

Although I myself cannot verify that all of the data in this file is
accurate, in my testing, I have found no errors and feel comfortable
assuming this as a basemark for any work going forward.
